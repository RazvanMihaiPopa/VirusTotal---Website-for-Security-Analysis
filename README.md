  A homework assignment during the PCLP4 course, where we had to design the front-end for a virustotal-like website and connect the front-end to the back-end. I also learned a bit about dockers, MongoDB, HTTP previously from the milestones 1(backend) and 2(middleware).

## Site

### Landing Page
A purple - blue-ish themed website. You can find these in the templates folder.
Succesfully added URLs to the database. Unfortunate with all the other functions like search a file, url and deleting them.

### Testing

Having docker installed and opened, you have to type 'make start' in the docker folder. You'll have to wait a bit. Then you open your HTML website and try creating an user and inspecting the page to see what happens!
